### Project Features: Multi-Layered Plagiarism Detection AI Agent



###### 1.Semantic Similarity Detection (Meaning-Based Analysis)

The system uses advanced NLP embeddings to compare the meaning of sentences rather than relying on exact word matches. This enables detection of plagiarism even when content is heavily paraphrased, rewritten, or expressed using different vocabulary while preserving the original intent.



###### 2.Paraphrase \& AI-Rewrite Detection Layer

A dedicated AI layer identifies content that has been reworded using paraphrasing tools or generated by AI models. It analyzes linguistic patterns, transformation styles, and sentence structures to flag suspicious rewrites that bypass traditional plagiarism detectors.



###### 3.Cross-Language Plagiarism Detection

The agent supports multilingual plagiarism checks by using cross-language embeddings or translation pipelines to compare documents written in different languages. This allows detection of plagiarism where content has been translated from a foreign source into another language.



###### 4.Stylometric Analysis (Author Writing Style Fingerprinting)

The system builds a writing profile for each user based on sentence length, vocabulary usage, punctuation habits, and grammatical patterns. It detects sudden style shifts within a document, helping identify ghostwriting, outsourced work, or AI-generated sections.



###### 5.Multi-Layer Confidence Scoring System

Detection results from all analytical layers (semantic similarity, paraphrase detection, cross-language analysis, and stylometry) are combined into a unified plagiarism risk score. A weighted scoring model reduces false positives and classifies submissions into Low, Medium, or High plagiarism risk categories.



###### 6.Explainable AI (XAI) Highlighting \& Reporting

The system provides transparent explanations for every flagged result by highlighting semantically similar sentences, paraphrased segments, and suspicious stylistic changes. It also displays probable source matches side-by-side, improving trust, interpretability, and decision-making for reviewers.



###### 7.Self-Learning Feedback Loop

The AI agent continuously improves through human feedback. Educators or reviewers can label results as “false positive” or “confirmed plagiarism,” enabling the system to retrain its models and adapt to new plagiarism patterns over time.
